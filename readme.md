### JavaScript 2D Game

Basic website starter
This repository contains basic files to get you started with a HTML and Javascript website. No library, nothing fancy.

## What's in this project?
← README.md: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← index.html: This is the main HTML page for your site.

← style.css: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

← script.js: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.

← favicon.ico: This is the icon of your website, that appears in the tab.

How to use this project
You could:

Use glitch to experiment with it directly in your browser - Select New Project -> Import from Github and paste the URL for this project: https://github.com/alicelieutier/minimal-html-starter

Download the files on your computer. On github, select Code -> Download Zip. Once you have the files, you can open index.html directly in your browser. If you want to have some javascript making API calls, however, you will need to run a local server. The easiest way is to run one of these lines in the terminal from the directory where index.html is.

Once you are able to see the webpage in your browser, change the files to see how it changes.
